# Day 1 - Pomodoro Timer

A pomodoro timer is used to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

-user can manually set the time
-when time is up a ringtone plays alerting the user the time is up
-the ring turns from green to red when the time is up

## Lessons Learned

I gained a better understanding of how Unix time works through the date time module. This was the first project that I implemented a soundbyte which required learning about the Audio object. There was a problem with the alert coming up before the ring turns red so I set the alert in a setTimeout function.

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Side Note

Since this is a challenge the HTML and CSS files were already written. The javascript is my solution.
